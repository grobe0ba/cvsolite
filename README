So, one day I had a crazy idea.
- What if we had a nifty CVS management tool like gitolite?
Thus, cvsolite was born.

Usage is fairly simple.
sh install.sh "public key"
The public key must be in quotes.

After that, checkout the config module.
To add a user, echo username public key >> userlist
In the userlist, do NOT put the public key in quotes
To remove a user, simply remove the line.

If you have a repository you only want the config user to have access to, add it to sec_repos.

=== WARNING ===
This should be run in a minimum of a chroot, and is currently set up to be run in a FreeBSD jail.
If you run it on bare hardware, that should be the ONLY thing that runs on there.
Security was not a concern when I wrote this, it uses sudo to modify user accounts on the fly, as well as using bash. It's basically one big security hole.
